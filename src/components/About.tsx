            <div className="history-intro">
              <p>
                The first Naga church was established in America on <strong>4th November 2018</strong> in DFW, Texas,
                113 years after the first Naga, Mr. Sanjamo Jungi landed in this country in 1905.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="history-vision">
              <h3>The Vision Begins</h3>
              <p>
                The inspiration behind the establishment of a Naga church came through
                <strong> Mr. Chuingachan Shokwungnao</strong>, a businessman by profession. For the first time, in 2006,
                he shared his God-given desire of planting a Naga church with his Naga brethren in Texas.
                Unfortunately, nothing came to fruition.
              </p>
              <p>
                In subsequent years, he put up multiple proposals but his dream of a Naga Church still did not
                materialize. This did not deter him and he continued to pursue his vision and kept sharing with
                as many Nagas as he could get in touch with. He continued his work for a Naga church in the face
                of strong oppositions and strive to see it fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although he did not have much knowledge about church planting, he had the utmost belief and
                confidence that a church of their own would not only foster closeness and fellowship among the
                scattered Nagas in the USA, but most importantly, that it would open the door for the Nagas to
                evangelize non-believers in America.
              </p>
              <p>
                He emphasized that Nagas must never forget the Americans -- for it was them who introduced the
                Nagas to the living God. He further stressed that a Naga church in this country could play a very
                important role in building a stronger relationship between American churches and Naga churches back home.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="history-founding">
              <h3>The Founding</h3>
              <p>
                In 2017, he met <strong>Mr. Visedelie Seyie</strong>, a student at South Western Baptist Theological
                Seminary and shared his vision of a Naga church. He became very committed to the idea and together
                they fervently worked with other like-minded Nagas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, on <strong>May 19, 2018</strong>, through the blessings of the Almighty God, the following
                Nagas, under extreme criticisms, took a firm decision to start the Naga church in America:
              </p>

                <li>Mr. Brian Kashung</li>

                <li>Ms. Abotoli Tuccu Sehgal</li>
                <li>Mr. Kaiser Kiirii (Monsang)</li>
              </ul>

            <div className="history-establishment">
              <h3>Establishment and Growth</h3>
              <p>
                The second meeting for the Naga church was held at Mr. Kughaho Chishi's residence. The following
                members were in attendance:
              </p>
              <ul className="attendees-list">
                <li>Mr. Mairising Damai</li>
                <li>Mr. Brian Kashung</li>
                <li>Mr. Mathingmi Hongchui</li>
                <li>Mr. Chuingachan Shokwungnao</li>
                <li>Ms. Themsing Wungsek Shokwungnao</li>
                <li>Mr. Kugaho Chishi</li>
                <li>Ms. Toshini Chishi</li>
                <li>Ms. Tolina Chishi</li>
                <li>Mr. Kinoto Chishi</li>
                <li>Mr. Nikoto Chishi</li>
                <li>Mr. Lanutenzuk Lemtur</li>
                <li>Mr. Visedelie Seyie</li>
                <li>Mr. Theishing Konghar</li>
                <li>Mr. Ningreithan Shaiza</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With God's blessings the first service was held on <strong>4th November 2018</strong> and it was during
                this meeting, the church was named <strong>"First Naga Baptist Church"</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                After much struggle in finding a pastor to lead the church the committee approached
                <strong>Mr. Lanutenzuk Lemtur</strong>, a graduate from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary
                with a Master of Arts in Biblical Counselling to be the pastor. He willingly accepted the
                responsibility of pastoring the new church.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around the same time, Mr. Kughaho Chishi, the worship leader of Burton Hill Baptist Church,
                shared the concern about finding a place to worship with his pastor, Dr. Terry Coley. He warmly
                welcomed the First Naga Baptist Church to use their facility free of cost, for which the church
                will remain grateful to Burton Hill Baptist Church.

              <p>
                In one of their meetings, the church planning committee members also decided to host the church's
                inauguration celebration on the <strong>10th and 11th of August 2019</strong> and invite the Naga
                church leaders from Nagaland, Manipur, and Myanmar to come and bless the occasion.
